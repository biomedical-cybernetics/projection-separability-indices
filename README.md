### Abstract

Evaluating data separation in a geometrical space is fundamental for pattern recognition. A plethora of dimensionality reduction algorithms have been developed in order to reveale the emergence of geometrical patterns in a low dimensional space of representation in which the highdimensional samples’ similarity is approximated by geometrical distances.  The aim of dimensiolaity reduction is indeed to preserve and unveil the relevant hidden structure of highdimensional data in a visible space. However, statistical measures to evaluate directly in the low dimensional geometrical space the sample group separability attaiend by these algorithms are missing. Certainly, these separability measures could be used both to compare algorithms’ performance and to tune algorithms’ parameters. Here, we propose three statistical measures (PS-ROC, PS-PR and PS-pvalue) which have origine from the Projection Separability (PS) rationale we propose, which is expressly designed to assess group separability of data samples in a geometrical space. Traditional cluster validity indices might be applied in this context but they show limitations because they are not specifically tailored for dimensionality reduction. PS measures were compared to several baseline cluster validity indices (such as Dunn, Davies-Bouldin, Bezdek, Calinski-Harabasz, Silhouette, and Thornton) using five non-linear datasets and six different dimensionality reduction algorithms. The results provide clear evidence that statistical-based measures based on PS rationale are more accurate in the evaluation of sample group separability in the Euclidean space and can be adopted to control the tuning of parameter-dependent dimensionality reduction algorithms.
